Restricted access to University computers Consistency in installation No concerns with software and focus on module content during the semester 1.1 Purpose This guide provides step-by-step description on how to install and access Python from your own computer. Three alternatives are described: (1) local installation via Docker; (2) native local installation; and, (3) remote access. 1.2 Installation Options Installation options depend on your operating system. This guide supports MacOS, Linux and Windows operating systems. 1.2.1 MacOS, Linux and Windows 10 Pro/Student users Figure 1.1 displays the installation options available for MacOS, Linux and Windows 10 Pro/Student users. The tree reflects our recommended installation. We strongly (1) local installation via Docker as the default option. If that is not possible, we recommend (2) native local installation as a second option. Failing this, we recommend (3) remote access to University computers. This last option requires good and stable internet connection. If any of these options work, you must attend one of the drop-in sessions in Foundation Week. Figure 1.1: Decision Tree: Recommended installation for MacOS, Linux and Windows 10 Pro/Student users For step-by-step instructions of the installation options listed in Figure 1.1, dedicated guides have been created. MacOS users should refer to Chapter 2. Linux users should refer to Chapter @ref{#linux}. Windows 10 Pro/Student users should refer to Chapter @ref{#win10pro}. 1.2.2 Other Windows users For other Windows users, including other versions of Windows 10, option (1) local installation via Docker is NOT available. Figure 1.2 shows the options available to these users. We strongly (1) a native local installation as the default option. If that is not possible, we recommend (2) remote access as a second option to University computers. Failing this, you must attend one of the drop-in sessions in Foundation Week. Step-by-step instructions for other Windows users are provided in Chapter {#otherwin}. Figure 1.2: Decision Tree: Recommended installation for other Windows users "]
